1. What is "culture"?

Culture is what people rely on when they interpret and explain reasons for feeling, thinking, and acting.



2. Why is it useful to express culture?

* Be cultural can provide interesting sources of believable individual variability.
* The role of cultural sameness is as important as psychological matching.
* Being able to express cultural cues like shrugs or winks makes agents feel more human-like.



3. How can an agent express culture?

* Adapting a character to a different culture involves careful reconsideration of each of the ten key characteristics  â€”  identity, backstory, appearance, content of speech, manner of speaking, manner of gesturing, emotional dynamics, social interaction patterns, role, and role dynamics.
* Each culture tends to evoke specific modes of adjustment and reactions in different situations.



4. Many of you have characters that are not human-like (a cat, a burger, etc.) Would you consider them expressing some culture? If yes, why and how would you do that. If no, then why not?

Expressing culture in agents is definitely something useful and helpful to do. Even just using the greetings that only local people use will make the agents feel more amiable. So, I'd like to express some culture whenever it's possible.
